Your code implementation is mostly correct, but there are some differences in how you are adding the backup options compared to the example you've provided. Let me clarify and check if your changes are fully correct based on the example you shared.

Example Structure:

def basic_ssl_query():
    query = PropstoreQuery(Environment.development, "my_system")\
        .add_coordinates({'application': 'my-app', 'region': 'am'})\
        .set_user_application_info("user_app_name", "v1.1.1")\
        .use_ssl(Regions.Americas)\
        .use_encrypted_backup(b'key', '/home/me/file.txt')
    
    print('PropstoreQuery retrieved:')
    for k, v in iteritems(query.get_data()):
        print(u"'{}' : '{}'".format(k,v))

Comparison and Corrections:

1. set_user_application_info():

In the example, they use .set_user_application_info("user_app_name", "v1.1.1") to set additional information about the application making the request. This is not included in your implementation.

It is not mandatory, but it could be useful to include this line if you need to track application versions or user-related information.



2. use_ssl():

The example uses .use_ssl() for specifying the SSL configuration. This is missing in your implementation.

If you are working with secure connections and require SSL, you should include this in your code to ensure secure communication with the Propstore.



3. use_encrypted_backup():

You are correctly adding the .use_encrypted_backup() option, similar to the example. However, ensure that your encryption key is properly formatted (byte-string starting with b'...'), and the path to the backup file is correctly set ('/path/to/backup_file.txt').



4. Backup Filename:

In your code, make sure the path to the backup file ('/path/to/backup_file.txt') is correct and accessible. The file path should be absolute and point to a writable directory.

The example uses a valid file path ('/home/me/file.txt'). Ensure you do the same in your code.




Revised Code Based on Example:

Here’s a slightly revised version of your code that follows the structure of the example:

def _get_propstore_props():
    global __propstore_map
    if not __propstore_map:
        query = PropstoreQuery(_get_propstore_env(), _lps_system)\
            .add_coordinates({'application': 'plainid-manage'})\
            .set_user_application_info("app_name", "v1.1.1")\  # Optional but useful for tracking
            .use_ssl(Regions.Americas)\  # Include this if SSL is required
            .use_encrypted_backup(b'YourEncryptionKeyHere', '/path/to/backup_file.txt')\
            .use_backup_file_before_fetching_from_server()
        
        try:
            __propstore_map = query.get_data()
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception("Error retrieving propstore properties, ")
        __log.info("Got propstore config of size")
    return __propstore_map

Key Changes:

set_user_application_info(): Tracks which application and version are making the request.

use_ssl(): Added to ensure SSL communication if needed.

Backup and Fallback: Your usage of .use_encrypted_backup() and .use_backup_file_before_fetching_from_server() is correct.


Conclusion:

The changes you’ve added are mostly right. The main differences are the missing set_user_application_info() and use_ssl(), which are useful but optional based on your specific use case. Ensure that the backup file path and encryption key are correctly set, and you should be good to go!
